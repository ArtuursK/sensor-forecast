# sensor-forecast
forecasting sensor data with vector autoregression 


Some tasks for the future:
```
[ ] account for moving forecast window 
[ ] try some alternatives for correlation
[ ] take into account the soil moisture external changes (watering), so maybe it does not have to be excluded
[ ] add other groups to compare not only the 3 suggested, and explain the choice
[ ] add and include other attributes as input to model training

[ ] add LSTM network extension
```
